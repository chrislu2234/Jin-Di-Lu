# Hello There!😊😊

😀 I'm Jin, but you can just call me Chris.

🏫 I'm currently a Bachelor of Information Sciences student studying at the University of Toronto iSchool. Specifically, my focus are in Data Science, Digital Humanities, and Human-Computer Interaction.

💻 This repository/profile primarily hosts my work in Data Analysis and Web Development. I've also dabbled a bit in UX and wrote essays in the domains of Digital Humanities and Information Practice in Organizations. I can provide a link for those who are interested!

📙 Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading works in Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology, Literature, and Economics. I spend my spare time playing League of Legends and TFT.

📚 As of last updating this, I'm currently reading Weike Wang's semi-biographical novel "Chemistry" and Byung-Chul Han's "The Burnout Society". My current favourite works  are: James Davies' "Sedated," Wayde Compton's "The Outer Harbour," Ha-Joon Chang's "23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism," and of course Levitt and Dubner's "Freakonomics." I highly recommend giving them a read.

🎓 I'm also interested in applying into Graduate School in the United States. Let me know if you're interested in my work and what I have to offer!
