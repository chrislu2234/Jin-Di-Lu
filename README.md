# Hello There!

I'm Chris.

I'm currently a Bachelor of Information Sciences student studying at the University of Toronto iSchool. I probably want to become a librarian.

This repository/profile primarily hosts my work in Data Analysis and Web Development. I also wrote essays in the domains of Digital Humanities and Information Practice in Organizations.

Outside of my studies, I read and I play games. Currently playing Rimworld right now.

As of last updating this, I'm currently reading Byung Chul Han's "Vita Contemplatavia". I'll post a reading list here later.

See you soon!
