Hello There!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

I'm Jin, but you can just call me Chris.

I'm currently a Bachelor of Information Sciences student studying at the University of Toronto iSchool. My studies specialize in the subjects of Data Science, Digital Humanities, and Human-Computer Interaction.

This repository/profile primarily hosts work I produce in the area of Data Analysis and Web Development. I've also dabbled a bit in UX and wrote essays in the domains of Digital Humanities and Information Practice in Organizations. I'll provide a link to those later for those interested!

Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading works of Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology, Literature, and Economics. I spend my spare time playing League of Legends and TFT.

As of last updating this, I'm currently reading through Weike Wang's semi-biographical novel "Chemistry" and Byung Chul Han's "The Burnout Society".

My current favourite works that I would highly recommend include: James Davies' "Sedated," Wayde Compton's "The Outer Harbour," Ha-Joon Chang's "23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism," and of course Levitt and Dubner's "Freakonomics."

Starting Mid-April, I'll working on a project that draws data from the Riot API in real time to provide complex statistical data on game outcomes in League of Legends. 

I'm also interested in applying into Graduate School in the United States. Let me know if you're interested in my work and what I have to offer!
