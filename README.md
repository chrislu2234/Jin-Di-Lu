Hello There!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

I'm Jin, but you can just call me Chris.

I'm currently a Bachelor of Information Sciences student studying at the University of Toronto iSchool. My studies specialize in areas such as Data Science and Digital Humanities. 

This repository/profile primarily hosts work I produce in the area of Data Analysis and Web Development. But I've also dabbled a bit in UX.

Outside of my work, I enjoy works in the areas of Psychology, Sociology, Literature, and Economics. I also predominantly spend my time playing League of Legends and TFT.

In similar fashion, I'm currently working on a project that draws data from the Riot API in real time to provide complex statistical data on game outcomes in League of Legends. The repository will be uploaded soon. 

You can reach me at: chrislu2234@gmail.com
See you soon!
